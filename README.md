#CALCULATOR DESIGN 

I made this concept design on Figma, and with
this mini repo project i will try to replicate it.

##Day one: 21 January 2014

I worked on how the calcultor's visible features
will look. I workd with CSS and HTML to make it
look at leats convinceing....

Challenges: I still have a tought time with making
most my desings responsive, and the artistic
side of things..

The bright Side: I managed to actually motivated myself
to use Figma and code something, with almost a sure idea
of what im doing.


##Day Three: 23 January 2024

I have learned how to manipulate the DOM a little bit, 
I still have a lot to learn  but I am happy with the 
progress I am maiking.

Challenges: I have a tough time  with making sense of how
things really work, and it's hard to beieve that a small
project like this would require such a huge client script file.

##Day Four: 24 January 2024

I lost the loop of Documenting my progress, and have been working for 
a long ass day, I am going to continue later.. I need know, to figure
out how will I make this function like a real calclator

###Day Five: 25 Janaury 2024.

I took a break and did not do anythig with regard to this programme.

###Day Six: 25 January 2024.

I still can't figure out how to make the calculator function, like
an actual calculator.
After soo may attemps and failures all i can say is I'm tired.
